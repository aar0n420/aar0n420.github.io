<h3>In other news, PlayerUnknown's: BattleGrounds has reached a milestone already, gaining over <em>1,000,000</em> concurrent players on Steam.</h3> <p>Meaning it has passed Dota 2 by 300,000 players and CounterStrike: Global Offence by 500,000 players. The game was only released 6 months ago and already has 10 million copies sold. This is almost nothing compared to how GTA V did on its first 24 hours, gaining <em>$800,000,000 worth of revenue with 11 million copies being sold.</em></p>
<p>This game is also set to release on Xbox One some time this year, as a publishing deal has been made between Microsoft Studios and PlayUnknown. This has a lot of PS4 users worried, as this could make the waiting time for PUBG on PS4 go up to possibly a year, and even a chance of it not being released on PS4 at all.</p>
