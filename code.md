<p>I will be talking about gaming and rap news</p>

<h1>The Xbox One X is due to launch soon, as pre-orders have begun.</h1>

<h3>In other news, PlayerUnknown's: BattleGrounds has reached a milestone already, gaining over 1,000,000 concurrent players on Steam.</h3> <p>It has passed Dota 2 by 300,000 players and CounterStrike: Global Offence by 500,000 players. The game was only released 6 months ago and already has 10 million copies sold. This is almost nothing compared to how GTA V did on its first 24 hours, gaining $800,000,000 worth of revenue with 11 million copies being sold.</p>
<p>This game is also set to release on Xbox One some time this year, as a publishing deal has been made between Microsoft Studios and PlayUnknown. This has a lot of PS4 users worried, as this could make the waiting time for PUBG on PS4 go up to possibly a year, and even a chance of it not being released on PS4 at all.</p>

<h3>Eminem's new movie has debuted in Toronto last week, with a lot of positive feedback.</h3>
<p>The battle rap satire produced by Eminem is largely based on racism in the battle rap scene.</p>

<h4>Watch the trailer here</h4>

<p>Much of the soundtrack is being made by Eminem himself and Dr.Dre, which is good news to many of Dre's fans, after he left the rap game back in 2015 with his last album, "Compton". Unfortunatly, neither will be seen in the movie itself. Eminem's last apperence on the big screen was in 2014 with his cameo in The Interview, but hasn't been in his own movie since his 2002 film 8 Mile.</p>
